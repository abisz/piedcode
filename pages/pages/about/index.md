Hey,

I'm Simon and I am deeply in love with the web and programming.

Computers and the possibilities they offer fascinate me. I'm convinced that we can profit in so many ways from being highly connected to each other and I'm thrilled by these fast moving times.

The idea of Open Source is something I'm very passionate about. For me this exchange reveals a new form of global collaboration with the motivation of building things. Open Source is highly democratic and convinces me not to lose faith in humanity :)

Anyway, this is my blog. I believe one can benefit from writing, that's why I do this.

If you want to get in touch write me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/simon_rsp), I would love to hear from you!

Keep Hacking!
