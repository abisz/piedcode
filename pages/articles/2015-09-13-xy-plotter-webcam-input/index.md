This is the documentation for a school project I did. The task was to build an interactive installation. My result is a X/Y- Plotter that draws a picture from a Webcam. The project was realized with Arduino (hardware) and Processing (software). The inspiration for the design of the plotter was from another [project](http://roxen.github.io/live-plotter/), I found on the web.

## Structure of the hardware
For basic structure I used the MakerBeam Starter Kit. I never worked with this kind of components before, but it was a good experience. Everything was mounted easily, it actually felt a bit like building something with Lego.

### Ball bearings
Additionally to the MakerBeam Starter kid I needed some ball bearings to secure smooth movement of the sleighs with the motors attached. Each sleigh is constructed using 10 bearings, four underneath, four at the sides and two on top of the arm. The Y-arm is supported by another bearing at the end.
